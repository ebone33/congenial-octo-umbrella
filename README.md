My website is based on chewy.com. I have included a main page, a page for pharmacy items, and a page each for dog and cat items.
I primarily used bootstrap to style the page. However, I did include a css stylesheet to customize the background color and font of my page. Specific elements include:
  - A logo and navagation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
  - Icons that include links to the dog and cat pages.
  - A hero banner on the pharmacy page.
  - A footer with copyright information.
The javascript items include:
  - a pop up item that instucts people to go to chewy.com when the search bar is clicked;
  - a function that changes the color of the shopping button green when clicked; and
  - a function that alerts people to enter text in the search bar. *Note - this function does not work because I have the earlier pop up item.
